# About
A Linux-like OS kernel written from scratch for OpenComputers mod. Currently does not even boot init.lua(not /init.lua at the root!) because I decided to rewrite it.

If you want to contribute to this project, please work on the [testing branch](https://github.com/WattanaGaming/OCLinux/tree/testing) and not this blank one.

# Credits
Z0idburg for providing some codebase and for teaching me stuff.

[Zen1th](https://github.com/zenith391/) for creating an improved fork of OCLinux. ~~Some of his code is integrated into the kernel instead of merging due to the code cleanup. His [fork](https://github.com/zenith391/OCLinux) is now officially different from the original is being developed independently.~~ His fork has disappeared mysteriously. RIP.
